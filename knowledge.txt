CSRF: aka one-click attack.
cross-site: attack comes from a different site
request: making an http request
forgery: forging the request

A cyberattack that tricks a user in performing unwanted actions on a web application while they are already authenticated.

Simple Example of an Attack:
1. You're logged into your bank website
2. Visit a malicious site in another tab
3. Malicious site has hidden form that sends to your bank (the bank cookies stored is also sent, making this request look like an authenticated request - so use `samesite` on cookies)
